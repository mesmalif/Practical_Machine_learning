# Anomaly detection using KNN

**Anomaly detection** is an interesting topic that is gaining interest in different industries. Anomaly detection algorithms in health care can point to health issues of patients and in the financial world, they can flag frauds. **K Nearest Neighbors** is an algorithm that can be used in both supervised and unsupervised approachs. 

[In this video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNDcPUeCEPI) I am explaining how unsupervised KNN can be applied in anomaly detection problems [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNDcPUeCEPI)
